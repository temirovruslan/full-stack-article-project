This app provides user registration and login functionality. Once logged in, users can create and delete articles. Each user has access only to their own articles.

To run the app after copying the GitHub repository, follow these steps:

1. Install the dependencies for the frontend by running npm install, and for the backend by running npm install.
2. Start the backend server by running npm start, and then start the frontend by running npm start.
3. It's not sure but frontend should be on port localhost:3000?

The app's owner utilizes a MongoDB database to store all the data.
